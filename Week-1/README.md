The folder is split into two subfolders - Beginner and non-beginner. If you are completely new to offsec or computer science in general, I highly encourage you to start in the beginner section as there are many new concepts, then move onto the proceeding section.

In some challenges, you may feel stuck or confused. Google is your best friend in these situations. Reading writeups is also extremely helpful in learning. In many of the following exercises, writeups can be found publicly: Simply search up the challenge name and "writeup", and you will find one. 

Note that you do not need to complete all exercises. Choose a category you like, and work from there! Every team member in a CTF has a role, and usually each will specialize in a specific category.
